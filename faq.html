            <p class="titleUnderline">Why do I need an FAQ? I don't I just like to answer questions!</p>
            <p>It's also a work in progress currently so if you see this then hi!</p>
            <div class="project_desc">
                <h3 class="text_underline">But who am I?</h3>
                <p>If for some reason you want to know more here are a couple facts of my life, <br>I'm transgender (Male to Female) yet to physically transition(Use whatever name/pronouns you would like), Bi-Sexual and i have Asperger's, Social Anxiety, Depression and too many interests.<br>ohh and normal lists dont work for me but i created a pseudocode like list instead called "TheAlexProgram", it actually really helps keep me focused even if it's a bit silly</p>

                <h3 class="text_underline">My Top 5 Games!</h3>
                <p>Portal 1, Portal 2, Titanfall 2, Minecraft, Black Ops 2</p>
                <p style="filter: brightness(75%);"><i>As of 1st May 2024<br>And the first 3 will never change as they are just perfect</i></p>
                
                <h3 class="text_underline">My Goal</h3>
                <p>Honestly my only goal has been to work on a "professional" project at a large company, this hasn't completely changed just<br>slightly shifted to be less important to me, as i've found value in working on personal projects and team indie projects.</p>
                <p style="filter: brightness(75%);"><i>Such as 'Oh, Flock!', 'The Bleed' and my own 'Can you come out tonight?'</i></p>

                <h3 class="text_underline">My Skills?</h3>
                <p>I like to learn so heres a fun list of all the languages and engines ive used personally and not professionally, but sadly I was very self destructive about old projects previously and sadly never kept them!</p>
