                <p>
                    This project was a very late/early morning attempt to help myself with time management, due to the suggestion of a friend and fellow student at the time I developed it into a discord bot designed for server use, it never saw the light of day on a large scale and was only implemented in our personal university discord.<br>
                    I truly am proud of this little bot that could, I sadly didn't have time to finish this project as it wasnâ€™t a priority and had to use my spare time to focus on my university modules.
