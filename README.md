# My Portfolio

This is the source for my github page, im using it as a nice wiki of my life sorta thingy.

Simply put its probably not amazing code, visually or performant, but as I learn ill fix and change stuff so please if u see an issue let me know!

**Important Note:**
It doesnt work properly on mobile, I will get around to adjusting the css for mobile versions eventually but its really not a priority ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

## Reflection
**I've been told to reflect more.**

Soo erm where to start. But honestly I learn't alot making this site, alot of the basics were made using about half of a tutorial on making a portfolio site, of which I can no longer find a link. if you think you know which one please do a pull request to change this document, or an issue with the link or name.

but ignoring that bit, I mainly had fun doing this, learning css and html more thoughly and figuring out how to layout properly was quite an experience and somewhat stressful at times, however it actually help alot when it came to understanding Unreal's UMG system and how they work together and layout.

anyway, im done here.. well not done it will be updated but like done reflecting and stuff.
