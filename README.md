# My Portfolio

This is the source for my GitHub page, Iâ€™m using it as a nice wiki of my life and I hope this will end up showing my progression along the game development path :D

**TODO:**
Fix mobile/low-width devices displaying strangely (currently displays message about screen size).

## Reflection
**I've been told to reflect more.**

I had fun doing this, learning CSS and html more thoroughly and figuring out how to layout properly was quite an experience and somewhat stressful at times, however it helps a lot when it came to understanding Unreal Engineâ€™s UMG system and how they work together and layout.

anyway, Iâ€™m done hereâ€¦ well not done it will be updated but done reflecting :)
